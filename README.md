The implementation consist of 3 main partf:
1) Data generation.
2) CRF language model training and test.
3) BERT language model training and test.

Data generation: The modules code is on '/GenerationPipe/'. The process of data generation is described in the jupyter notebook '/JN/FinalProject_Part_1-data_generation.ipynb'.

CRF language model training and test: A pre-training tokenization is described on the jupyter notebook '/JN/FinalProject_Part_2-feature_extraction.ipynb'. 
Training and testing are described on jupyter notebook '/JN/FinalProject_Part_3-CRF_train_test.ipynb'.

BERT language model training and test: A pre-training tokenization, training and testing are described on '/JN/FinalProject_Part_3-BERT_Heb_Punc.ipynb'


It is a collaboration of Hanan Zaichik, Moshe noivirt and Moshe shechner.
